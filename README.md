## 1.1 INTORDUCTION
Second hand cars have a huge market base and many people consider buying an used car instead of getting a new one.Considering that their so many frauds in the market who not only sale wrong but also mislead to wrong price.This project aims at solving the problem of predicting the price of a used car, using machine learning techniques.We'll try to predict the price of used cars based on their features.This will help people to decide whether the used car is worth the posted price by different online sites used.This will help people when they plan selling their cars.

## 2 NOTEBOOK STRUCTURE
The python notebook is structured as follows:
## 3 METHODOLOGY
The following steps were taken in order to clean the data using this notebook:

The data was checked for null values where it was discovered that all the columns apart from manufacturer and price had null values present.
The null values was handled on a column by column basis; dropping the null values for some and filling the null values manually based on further analysis and by checking the cars45 site.
Some columns were not in their appropriate data type so this was corrected.
Further preprocessing was done on the color column to replace the ambiguous color names to simpler names.

### 3.1 REGRESSION ANALYSIS
Formally, a regression analysis consists of a series of statistical processes aimed at estimating the relationships existing between a set of variables; in particular we try to estimate the relationship between a special variable called dependent (selling Price) and the remaining independent variables (the other features). This analysis made it possible to understand how the value of the dependent variable changes as the value of any of the independent variables change.
#### 3.1.1 Data Analysis
In this Project, we are going to predict the Price of Used Cars using various features like  Selling_Price, Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type, Year etc. The data used in this project was downloaded from Kaggle.
#### 3.1.2 Data Preprocessing
